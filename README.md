# 05 Server Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## City Weather

This application allows to user to type in a city name and get both the current weather and a five day forecast. The temps, humidity, uv index and wind speed are all shown, in addition to a weather icon. The searched cities are added as buttons so that they can be easily looked at again, and they are even saved to local storage so that the user can come back after refreshing and still see their cities of interest.
